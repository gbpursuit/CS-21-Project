# 2048 in MIPS  

This project was developed as part of our **CS21: Computer Organization and Architecture** course. The goal was to create a modified version of the **2048 game**, where the board size is configurable, and the winning condition is dynamically determined based on the board size **n**.  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview  
In this implementation, we extended the classic **2048 game** by allowing different board sizes, ranging from **3x3** to **nÃ—n**. The larger the board, the higher the target tile value required to win.  

### ðŸ“Œ **Key Features:**  
- **Dynamic Board Size:** Supports **3x3**, **4Ã—4**, **5Ã—5**, **6Ã—6**, and an extendable **nÃ—n** version.  
- **MIPS Assembly Implementation:** Written in **MIPS Assembly**, focusing on **register-based data storage** instead of arrays.  
- **Winning Condition:** The game ends when a tile reaches **2048** (or a higher value, depending on board size).  
- **Optimized for Registers:** A special **exponent-based encoding** was used to store tile values efficiently.
